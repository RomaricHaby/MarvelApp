# Marvel App

## Functionality
* Paginated list of Marvel characters with the number of times they appear in a comic, series, stories
* Detailed view of a character with a paginated list of its comics
* Unit testing on domain and data
* Workflow, I have an error it can't find the API keys for the unit tests run from the workflow but on Android Studio its working fine 
* Small problem with Git Hub I have not created my develop branch from master so I can't merge it on, end I did some Houdin ðŸ˜‚. So I passed the develop branch in default.
